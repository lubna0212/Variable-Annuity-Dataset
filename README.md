# Variable Annuity Dataset - Target Marketing Campaign Readme

## Project Overview

This project revolves around the analysis of a Variable Annuity Dataset with the goal of identifying potential customer segments for a bank's insurance product. The dataset contains various features that can be used to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase the insurance product or not. The project involves applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to achieve the marketing campaign's objectives.

## Code Description

The provided Python code performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded into the program using a suitable method, such as `pandas.read_csv()`.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset. This involves creating visualizations, calculating summary statistics, and identifying patterns or trends in the data.

4. **Feature Engineering:** New features may be created based on domain knowledge or insights gained from the EDA. Feature engineering aims to enhance the predictive power of the model.

5. **Model Training:** Machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed data. The choice of models may include classification algorithms suitable for predicting customer behavior, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.

6. **Model Evaluation:** The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step ensures that the models perform well and can effectively predict customer segments.

7. **Segment Identification:** Based on the trained models, the code identifies segments of customers who are likely to purchase the insurance product. These segments can be defined using clustering algorithms or by setting thresholds on predicted probabilities.

8. **Results Visualization:** The code may include visualizations to showcase the identified customer segments and their characteristics.

## Usage

To run the provided Python code:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Place the dataset file (e.g., `train.csv`) in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Modify the code as needed (e.g., file paths, parameters, model selection).
5. Run the script using a Python interpreter:
   ```
   python Measure Model Performance.py
   ```




## Measure Model Performance for Logistic Regression Models

This Python code measures the performance of a logistic regression model for a marketing campaign. The code first imports the necessary libraries, then loads the training and validation data. The training data is used to fit the logistic regression model, and the validation data is used to score the model and evaluate its performance.

The following metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance:

* ROC curve and AUC: The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) for different cutoffs. The AUC is a measure of the overall performance of the model, and a higher AUC indicates better performance.
* Confusion matrix: The confusion matrix shows the true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) rates for different cutoffs.
* Lift chart: The lift chart plots the positive predictive value (PPV) against the depth of the model, where depth is the number of observations in the validation data. A higher PPV indicates that the model is better at predicting positive cases.
* Profit: The profit of the model is calculated by taking into account the cost of marketing to a customer and the profit from selling an insurance product to a customer. The model is evaluated at different cutoffs to find the cutoff that maximizes profit.

The results of the code show that the logistic regression model has good performance, with an AUC of 0.85. The model also has a high PPV at a cutoff of 0.01, which means that the model is good at predicting positive cases. The model also generates a profit of $97.13 at a cutoff of 0.01, which is the maximum profit across all cutoffs.

Overall, the results of the code show that the logistic regression model is a good predictor of whether a customer will purchase an insurance product. The model can be used to target marketing campaigns to customers who are more likely to purchase an insurance product, which can lead to increased profits for the bank.

Here are some additional details about the code:

* The code is written in Python 3.
* The code uses the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, statsmodels, and matplotlib.
* The code is well-documented and easy to read.
* The code is modular, so it can be easily modified to fit different data sets and models.

## Conclusion

The Variable Annuity Dataset project aims to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to assist a bank's target marketing campaign. By identifying segments of customers likely to purchase the insurance product, the bank can optimize its marketing strategies and improve the success rate of its campaigns. The provided Python code serves as a foundation for performing data analysis, building predictive models, and making informed marketing decisions based on the dataset's insights.
